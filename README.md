# FacialRecognition
A facial recognition app using Siamese Neural Network and deployment of the model in Kivy.

First, the dataset is taken from the webcam itself in real time and stored in a folder. A bunch of other images(negative) is downloaded from LFW i.e Labelled Faces in the Wild Dataset. Then, the model is trained and tested using the Siamese Neural Network using Convolution and Adam Optimizers. 

Finally, the model is saved as a h5 file and it is deployed in real time using Kivy in the VS Code.
